When dealing with mobile apps, especially ones that involve e-commerce, often times, developers need to include a barcode scanner service right into their mobile apps. 

This sample demonstrates the barcode scanner service in Crosslight. Made from the ground up, the barcode scanner service supports more than 20+ types of barcodes around the world, ensuring maximum compatibility against multiple barcode types. You can even scan VCard QR codes with it.
